Files:
1) project3.cpp - the driver program, gives the user a menu of commands to choose from and serves as the communication baseline for the rest of the program.
    contains the Node struct and the BTree class, as well as all of the function definitions for these objects.

2) devlog.md - a journal containing all of my thoughts and timestamped work sessions throughout the course of this project

3) readme.txt - you are here. tells you everything you need to know (I hope)

For compilation:
project3.cpp, must be compiled using g++ and -std=c++11 (or higher)

For execution:
After compiling, run ./project3 and the menu will give a description of how to run its commands.

Tools used:
files were compiled, run, and tested on the cs1 utdallas server using MobaXterm, but any UNIX terminal should work
all code was written (but not tested) in VS code with c++ extensions
